These are the slides used at JSConf.us 2013 (the v3 was actually used in the prezo).

v1 and v2 were my original slides. They go through the code step-by-step and have generally too much data. After an A/B test it turned out that nobody was really able to follow it so I started over and went for a live coding approach.

I've put the v1 and v2 here for ... well, whatever :)

The talk will be released some time in the future and I'll hopefully remember to link to it here :) Till then, I think v1/v2 make more sense without the talk than v3 will.
